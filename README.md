# Python AI Fundamentals Repository

This collection demonstrates core principles and techniques in Artificial Intelligence using Python. Each folder covers a distinct topic‚Äîfrom search algorithms to probabilistic reasoning‚Äîand includes standalone scripts you can run directly.

## üöÄ Overview

* **Search Algorithms**

  * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  * Depth-First Search (DFS)
  * A\* Search
* **Game Playing**

  * Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
* **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning**

  * Propositional Logic Solvers
  * Inference Engines
* **Planning Methods**
  
  * GraphPlan
* **Probabilistic Models**

  * Bayesian Networks
* **Machine Learning Essentials**

  * Decision Trees
  * Na√Øve Bayes Classifier

## üìã Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
* (Optional) A virtual environment for dependency isolation
* No additional build tools required

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Examples

Each subdirectory contains one or more Python scripts along with a README explaining any extra inputs. Generally, you‚Äôll run a script as follows:

```bash
cd <topic_folder>
python3 example.py [optional_input.txt]
```

* **`example.py`**: Main script for the demonstration.
* **`[optional_input.txt]`**: Some algorithms (e.g., search on a graph) may require a data file. See that folder‚Äôs README for specifics.

Each script‚Äôs header or accompanying README will detail:

* Command-line arguments (if any)
* Expected input file format
* Configuration flags (e.g., verbose logging)
